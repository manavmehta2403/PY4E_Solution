"""
It used to store the user data in the computer even 
when the power is cut off.
Stores the code in the computer.
"""
#(c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle


#Q2 
"""
Program is the piece of code written by the programmer
to execute the program which have some inputs that 
operates using language to produce output for the user
"""

#Q3
"""
Compiler is the process of executing the whole code as one file
which execute at the faster rate but it makes the debugging hard.

Interperter runs the code line by line which executes at every point
and this makes it slower but it makes the debugging easier as some
part of the code is executed.
"""

#Q4
"""(a) The python interpretor converts the python source code.
"""

#Q5
'''primt 'Hello world!'''

"""Syntax error as print is used instead of primt and also the 
paranthesis is missing."""

#Q6
"""x is stored temporary than it must be store in the main memory.
(b)"""

#Q7
#varaible x is storing the int data type as 43
x = 43
# 1 is added to x and stored back to x
x = x + 1
# printing x that is 43 + 1 = 44 (b)
print(x)

#Q8
"""
1) If in humans, the CPU is the human brain. where everything is processed 
before sending.
2) RAM memory in humans is that while we can not we keep it permanently. 
human memory is stored in the first layer of our brain.
3) Secondary memory (hard drive) if the human is our brain on the fourth layer. 
according to medical science at the fourth layer of our memories are permanently stored. and can not be lost, unless we remove (memory loss).
4) on a computer input device for example a keyboard and mouse. in humans are 
the ears, eyes and nose.
5) if the output device is a computer monitor or speakers. Another case with 
humans, the human output device is the statement or answers that arise over what we feel, see, or hear. for example if we smell the odor from the input device (nose), we will process it on our CPU (brain), then create an answer that means the output device.
"""

#Q.9 
"""Python can only execute the program only if the program contains 
a line - command line with the correct syntax. If the program - the program 
there is a syntax error then the process will stop and display the message - 
the error message, which became known as syntax errors. Syntax refers to 
a program structure and rules - rules that play a role in the structure. 
For example, in the Indonesian language, a sentence should begin with 
capital letters and end with a dot (.), 
The sentence will have a syntax error when writing the sentence does not comply 
with the applicable rules. This is also true in the language computer programming."""

#print(43 + *2) => This code will give the error therefore 
#eval is used as string to check error at the specific part
'''print(eval("43 + 2 + * 3"))'''
